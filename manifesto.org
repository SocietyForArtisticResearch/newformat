* Spatialized/Temporalized Knowledge
* Structure:  
** Data (text file rdf, content, tools, relations, ontology extensions) 
** Exposition Ontology (owl, structure and possible relations of exposition, defintions on public uri) 
** Renderers (Html, grid-based, time-based, Pdf, Svg, (and mixtures) etc)
* Versioning of data, renderer, objects, ontology (use git), time machine 
* Exposition as a queryable object 
* Validation 
* Temporal properties of objects
* "Printing" making an networked object autonomous
* Reading/viewing can be traced, affect the data, taking notes, collective note taking (threads) etc (feedback)
* Everything newly defined needs to have relation to what is already there
* Each object/paragraph has DOI and can be annotated
* Media object can have a life of their own, not isolated but can be shared, searched etc.
* Object/Text organization/relation before visual placement 
* database api
* Reading: 
** Mapping/Navigation
** Search/exploration within expositions, different types
* Writing process:
** No waste in actions of user. Recording/effect on meaning
** Reward and ease of use for metadata (visualizations of structure)
** generating paths
** multiple views in the editor, list view, graph view, map view, layout view
** start describing by a path, skeleton (diagram language)
