****** footnote
****** description
****** explanation
****** caption
****** subtitle
****** reference (bibliographical, data provenance)
****** representation
****** realization
***** Comparison
we need something that checks for inconsistencies/incoherent order
****** bigger than, smaller than
****** context (e.g. order on page, quality) 

* Layout
** Container (2D)
*** has sorting context that can be changed
can contain other containers, RC-specific div

one way of expressing the grid:
containerid, display, grid
subcontainerid, grid-row, 1
subcontainerid, grid-column, 1

containerid, contains, subcontainerid

** Graph 
graph:

 startid, path, endid.

* Position relation
