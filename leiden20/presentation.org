- Relating things, expressing structure
- Absolute positioning (poster and page printing paradigms)
- "Visucentrism"
- Materiality of the digital medium
- Digital obsolescence 

* The Exposition as a Digital Object
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Digital objects exist in relation to their milieux
- Malleable entity that adapts
- Multiplicity of rendering methods, ways of querying 
- Role of the author
- Format specification

** Relations

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Data (such as text, media objects, etc.) can be related 
  - Visually (above, below, etc.)
  - Temporally (after, before, etc.)
  - Semantically (annotation, comment, reference, representation, etc.)   
- Networks of relation that can be *rendered* and *transposed*
- Multiple layers of relations

*** Respond to display device
*** Program the behavior of an exposition
*** A format makes exposition independent from a single implementation
*** Dynamic entity that can be connected to services, devices and other digital objects
*** Ensure (long term) accessibility
*** Extensibility 


  static two-dimensional visual presentation

  temporal
  malleability and its existence in a multiplicity of milieux
